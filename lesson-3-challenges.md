# Challenges
This chapter is all about practicing! Now, it's time to get your hands dirty and improve your knowledge of Javascript.

You will find in the folder `lesson-3-challenges`, 12 files. There is 6 challenges and their solutions written in a separate file named `challenge-<number>-solution`. Don't look straight away the answers! Try to solve these challenges in `Repl.it` _(how to run your code below)_ and compare your results with the solution. If you are stuck, don't worry, we are here to help!

### Where to Run Your Code
As you write code, you'll want to be able to see what it does. For this, you need to "run it" somewhere. You can do this in a number of ways, but to keep things simple, we are going to use a tool called `Repl.it`(https://replit.com/). Create an account, and start a new project on the site. Make sure to select JavaScript as your language of choice.
