# Challenge 4: FizzBuzz

Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3 print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of 5 print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”.

Counting to 15 should look like this:

```js
1
2
'Fizz'
4
'Buzz'
'Fizz'
7
8
'Fizz'
'Buzz'
11
'Fizz'
13
14
'FizzBuzz'
```
